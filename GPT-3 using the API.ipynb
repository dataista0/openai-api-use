    "In 1981 the first IBM PC was found and in the following years technology has been developing with such a speed that today we only need to press one button to send information all over the world. There is a big number of TV channels providing us with information of all sorts, like documentaries, news, scientific programmes etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "But not everything shown on TV has an educational or informing value. In fact, the chance of finding something really interesting when you switch on the box is slim. The most programmes are boring because they are repeats of soap operas you did not want to see the first time they were shown or films you have already seen a dozen times or just stupid competition programmes.\n",

    "\n",
    "It is the continuation to part 1, which ends with a mystery: you did not know what happened with the group of teenagers. This time there is also a group of students, who want to try to solve the enigma about the \"Blair Witch Projekt\" again. The story takes place in the forest and in my view is this the main reason why you will be scared. The whole movie you can see the dark, lonely, large and mysterious forest and apart from that the character of the students change again and again and so you do not know who is the victim and who is the villain.\n",
    "\n",
    "In my opinion it is a movie, which you will never forget, because it is not like others. The movie is based on a 'low budget film' and so it is a special kind of entertainment. That is the reason why I am sure that it is a movie, which can reach the Top 100 of the best movies.\n",
